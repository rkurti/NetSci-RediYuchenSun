Hello. This is the project for the football clubs transfer market. Please know that the file can be simply be ran by using the following command:
"python ./WebscrapingProgram.py"
The following program runs automatically to scrape data from 2000 to 2018. No new HTML files were found but used the existing. We used the ones saved by Rohit and Hosea because the website, Transfermarkt, has changed its HTML format since the last time the two finished their projects. Sadly, there is no new data but we made things more risk-free by recycling their HTML files, making only the filtering in the Python “WebscrapingProgram.py” more convenient.

The URL to our WordPress website is the following:

We thank you for your help and the effort to optimize learning and progress through this module. I hope you have a nice Fall Break.

Thank You.
